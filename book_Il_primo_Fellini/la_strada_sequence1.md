## Theoretical Model — *La Strada*, Sequence I (TEI-encoded excerpt)

The excerpt selected from *La Strada* represents the opening sequence in which
Zampanò purchases Gelsomina from her mother and begins their journey together.
This passage is crucial within both the film narrative and the broader cultural
context of the Renzo Renzi collection.

From a documentary and curatorial perspective, the sequence illustrates:

- **Character introduction and characterization**  
  Zampanò and Gelsomina are defined through dialogue, physical description,
  and social context, establishing the emotional and thematic foundations of
  the story.

- **Depiction of poverty, marginality, and performance**  
  The setting of the seashore, the shack settlement, and the dynamics within
  Gelsomina’s family reflect the post-war socio-economic background frequently
  explored by Fellini and analyzed by Renzi in his writings.

- **Editorial relevance for Renzo Renzi’s work**  
  The text derives from the book *Il primo Fellini* (edited by Renzo Renzi),
  which documents early Fellini works through scripts, notes, and commentary.
  The TEI excerpt functions as both a textual witness and an interpretative
  tool within the archival sub-collection.

- **Intermedial and intertextual relationships**  
  This sequence forms links to:
  - the **film** (*La Strada*, 1954),
  - the **soundtrack** (Nino Rota),
  - the **photograph** (Fulgor cinema, representing public reception),
  - the **caricature** by Fellini (expressive representation of Renzi),
  - the **video interview** (oral memory of the period),
  creating a conceptual network across objects.

In this project, the excerpt is encoded using **TEI P5**, focusing on:
- structural hierarchy (scenes, stage directions, transitions)
- speaker identification and dramatic markup
- contextual metadata (participants, places, bibliographic source)
- separation of content and presentation (via XSLT → HTML)

The TEI file acts as the **textual component** of the Renzi sub-collection,
demonstrating how narrative and archival materials can be integrated into a
semantic knowledge graph and published as interoperable digital resources.
